PSM II Trainings Deck

### Scrum Framework
The Scrum framework consists of Scrum Teams and their associated roles, events, artifacts, and
rules. Each component within the framework serves a specific purpose and is essential to
Scrum’s success and usage.
Specific strategies for using the Scrum framework vary and are described elsewhere.
The rules of Scrum bind together the events, roles, and artifacts, governing the relationships and
interaction between them. The rules of Scrum are described throughout the body of this
document.

## Scrum Theory
Scrum is founded on empirical process control theory, or empiricism. Empiricism asserts that
knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known. Scrum
employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk.
Three pillars uphold every implementation of empirical process control: transparency,
inspection, and adaptation.

### Transparency
Significant aspects of the process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome.
Transparency requires those aspects be defined by a common standard so observers share a
common understanding of what is being seen.
For example:
A common language referring to the process must be shared by all participants; and,
A common definition of “Done”1 must be shared by those performing the work and those
accepting the work product.

### Inspection
Scrum users must frequently inspect Scrum artifacts and progress toward a goal to detect
undesirable variances. Their inspection should not be so frequent that inspection gets in the way
of the work. Inspections are most beneficial when diligently performed by skilled inspectors at
the point of work.

### Adaptation
If an inspector determines that one or more aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable
limits, and that the resulting product will be unacceptable, the process or the material being
processed must be adjusted. An adjustment must be made as soon as possible to minimize
further deviation.
Scrum prescribes four formal opportunities for inspection and adaptation, as described in the
Scrum Events section of this document.

### Scrum
Scrum is a framework structured to support complex product development. Scrum consists of
Scrum Teams and their associated roles, events, artifacts, and rules. Each component within the
framework serves a specific purpose and is essential to Scrum’s success and usage.

### The Scrum Team
The Scrum Team consists of a Product Owner, the Development Team, and a Scrum Master.
Scrum Teams are self-organizing and cross-functional. Self-organizing teams choose how best to
accomplish their work, rather than being directed by others outside the team. Cross-functional
teams have all competencies needed to accomplish the work without depending on others not
part of the team. The team model in Scrum is designed to optimize flexibility, creativity, and
productivity.
Scrum Teams deliver products iteratively and incrementally, maximizing opportunities for
feedback. Incremental deliveries of “Done” product ensure a potentially useful version of
working product is always available.

### The Product Owner
The Product Owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product and the work of the
Development Team. How this is done may vary widely across organizations, Scrum Teams, and
individuals.
The Product Owner is the sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog. Product
Backlog management includes:
Clearly expressing Product Backlog items;
Ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions;
Ensuring the value of the work the Development Team performs;
Ensuring that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all, and shows what
the Scrum Team will work on next; and,
Ensuring the Development Team understands items in the Product Backlog to the level
needed.

The Product Owner may do the above work, or have the Development Team do it. However, the
Product Owner remains accountable.
The Product Owner is one person, not a committee. The Product Owner may represent the
desires of a committee in the Product Backlog, but those wanting to change a backlog item’s
priority must convince the Product Owner.
For the Product Owner to succeed, the entire organization must respect his or her decisions. The
Product Owner’s decisions are visible in the content and ordering of the Product Backlog. No
one is allowed to tell the Development Team to work from a different set of requirements, and
the Development Team isn’t allowed to act on what anyone else says.

### The Development Team
The Development Team consists of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially
releasable Increment of “Done” product at the end of each Sprint. Only members of the
Development Team create the Increment.
Development Teams are structured and empowered by the organization to organize and
manage their own work. The resulting synergy optimizes the Development Team’s overall
efficiency and effectiveness. Development Teams have the following characteristics:
They are self-organizing. No one (not even the Scrum Master) tells the Development Team
how to turn Product Backlog into Increments of potentially releasable functionality;
Development Teams are cross-functional, with all of the skills as a team necessary to create
a product Increment;
Scrum recognizes no titles for Development Team members other than Developer,
regardless of the work being performed by the person; there are no exceptions to this rule;
Individual Development Team members may have specialized skills and areas of focus, but
accountability belongs to the Development Team as a whole; and,
Development Teams do not contain sub-teams dedicated to particular domains like testing
or business analysis.
